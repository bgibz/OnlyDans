## About

This is a joke, obviously, but I might have taken it too far.

I built this because one of my friends is named Dan, and we like to poke fun at each other. This is a Next.js clone of OnlyFans built using tailwind.css. It's front end only, the point wasn't really to build something functional, but to mock up something taht works as a joke among our friends.
